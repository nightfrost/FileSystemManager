# FileSystemManager
FSM is a file manager software, that lets your manage given files. The application loops through the menus, giving the user various different options, depending on menu.
1. The first menu lets you continue to manage files, view the log, or exit the program.
2. The second menu lets you list all the files, list specific files, manage a specific .txt file and exit back.
3. The third menu lets you list file name, file size, number of lines in a file, search for a word and exit back.
